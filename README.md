#### Motivation

1. This game will help me understand CSS better and improve on it
2. This game will also help me to review my javascript basics and logic

#### Creating a wireframe 

> The wireframes are the floor plan for your website, creating a vessel for which design and content can flow into.

- First step is to draw up a rough sketch of how my final design will look like. This will help me to break down step by step on how the logic of my game will be. 

- Second step is to identify where I need to place my divs in my HTML and also consider whether or not I should use bootstrap(?) (i.e having my donut box as a background image so that I can place my selected donuts on top of the box)

- Third step is to identify what javascript syntax I would need to use (i.e storing my donuts in an array as a string)

- Fourth step is to do the logic aspect of the game.

#### MVP

- Be able to click on the donut and have it to populate the box

#### Stage 1

Creating my html and implementing the divs inside of it as per my rough sketch
